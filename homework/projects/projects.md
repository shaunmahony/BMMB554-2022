# Course project

A core component of BMMB/MCIBS 554 is the execution of a course project that applies data analysis tools to a biological problem. **You may come up with your own project.** The scope of allowable projects is broad; as long as you are analyzing biological data or implementing an approach that we've discussed in the course, I am likely to allow it. For those of you who are working in labs or doing rotations: I particularly encourage you to do a project that has relevance to your own research. The only condition is that you ask your advisor in advance for permission to use/present any proprietary data in this course.

Ideally, each person should come up with their own individual project. You may work in pairs (i.e., maximum of 2 people) if the project can allow clearly separable contributions from each person.

When grading your projects, I will favorably take into account your background and pre-course skills. For example, if you never coded before this class but integrate some python coding into your project.

*If you have absolutely no ideas for projects, let me know and we'll come up with something.*
