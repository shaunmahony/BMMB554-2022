# Homework 4

Describe a current challenge in biology and the computational approaches that could be (or are) used to solve that challenge. In describing the biological challenge, include appropriate detail about the underlying biology and motivate why the challenge is of interest. In describing the computational solutions, provide an outline of how appropriate methods or algorithms work, any barriers or challenges in applying the approaches, and how the results would be interpreted. 

Answers should be ~2 pages in length, excluding citations (i.e., citations should be provided, but do not count towards the expected answer length). Standard formatting expected (11pt standard font, single-spaced, 1‚Äù margins). 

While anyone may write about any appropriate topic, research graduate students (i.e., Ph.D. and research Masters) are welcome to describe their current or future research topic. Non-research students may write directly about topics covered in this course, with the understanding that a complete answer to this assignment will require research beyond the material covered during lectures (e.g., reading and referencing appropriate review articles).
