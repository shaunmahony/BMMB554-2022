# BMMB554 | Foundations In Data Driven Life Sciences | Spring 2022


## Place and Time

218 Thomas Building | Tuesday, Thursday 10:35am - 11:50am EST


## Instructor

**Shaun Mahony**

[sam77@psu.edu](mailto:sam77@psu.edu?Subject=BMMB554)

404 Sth Frear Bldg.

Office hours: Appointments via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/shaun-mahony/office-hours). Zoom appointments strongly preferred for now. 


## Course Logistics & Materials
Course materials will be posted here: https://hackmd.io/@shaunmahony/rk-5fTgnF.

These course materials will be archived on [GitHub](https://github.com/shaunmahony/BMMB554-2022).

We will also use [Canvas](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2163959) for some assignment submissions and for course communication. If you haven’t already changed your settings so that Canvas emails go directly to your@psu.edu account, you should do so. Whenever possible, audio and/or video recordings of lectures and associated discussions will also be posted to Canvas. Participation in class discussion will be taken as constituting your implicit permission for such recordings to be made and posted. 

COVID-19 policies: In accordance with university guidelines, masks should be properly worn in the classroom at all times. Food and drink are not allowed in the classroom. In accordance with university guidelines, students who test positive for COVID-19 should not attend class and should follow all UHS quarantine/isolation policies. It is strongly recommended that students who feel sick, display any COVID-19 symptoms, or have had close contact with COVID-19 positive individuals should not attend class. There will be no grade penalty for COVID-19 related absences. Unfortunately, Penn State has required that the large majority of this course be delivered in-person, so no virtual option will be available for those who cannot attend class. However, all course materials and lecture recordings (where possible) will be made available at the links above. If the instructor cannot attend class in-person, then the course may be temporarily delivered via Zoom. A Zoom link will be emailed to the class in that eventuality. 

## Course Description
This course will provide an intensive introduction to data analysis in the life sciences. Topics are organized around three main themes: 1) Essential data analysis tools; 2) Basic algorithms for DNA sequence analysis; 3) Practical problem solving in genomic application domains. The course aims to provide the foundational skills for analyzing biological data using computational methods. A major component of the course will be the execution of a course project that applies data analysis tools to a biological problem. 

## Course Objectives
* Gain introductory skills in Python programming and learn how it applies to biological data analysis settings. 
* Understand basic computational algorithms used in DNA sequence analysis settings. 
* Learn how to analyze genomic data with bioinformatics tools.
* Understand current computational challenges facing genomics research. 

## Course Assessment
Performance in the course will be assessed by grades on project deliverables, homework assignments, oral presentations, and participation in class. No examinations will be given. Grades will be posted on Canvas. Any grading issues should be discussed with the instructor during office hours, not before or after class. Course grades will be split as follows:

Participation: 20%, Homework assignments: 40%, Final projects: 40%


## Attendance, Participation, & Late Work
Due to the COVID-19 policies described above, no grade penalty will be assessed for absences. However, aside from COVID-related absences, everyone is expected to join class at the appropriate times. Repeated absences for non-COVID-related reasons will result in a reduced participation grade. Participation grades will also be assessed based on the degree to which each individual joins in in-class discussions. 

Assignments are due on the dates specified and must be uploaded to Canvas before the relevant deadline. I do not accept late work or emailed work unless announced otherwise or agreed in advance. 

## Laptops, Tablets, & Phones
You will need to bring a laptop to class to follow along with the practical exercises. It’s also fine to take notes using a laptop or tablet. However, any non-class related use of any device during the lecture (including browsing the web, text/instant messaging, social media, etc.) will result in a grade penalty for class non-participation. 

## Eberly College of Science Teaching Statements
The Eberly College of Science Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation embodies the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess and will endorse to make The Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded. https://science.psu.edu/climate/support-and-resources/code-of-mutual-respect-and-cooperation. The Eberly College of Science is committed to the academic success of students enrolled in the College's courses and undergraduate programs. When in need of help, students can utilize various College and University wide resources for learning assistance: http://www.science.psu.edu/advising/success. 
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at 814-863-1807 (V/TTY). For further information regarding ODS, please visit the Office for Disability Services Web site at http://equity.psu.edu/ods/. To receive consideration for course accommodations, you must contact ODS and provide documentation (see the documentation guidelines at http://equity.psu.edu/ods/guidelines/documentation-guidelines). If the documentation supports the need for academic adjustments, ODS will provide a letter identifying appropriate academic adjustments. Please share this letter and discuss the adjustments with your instructor as early in the course as possible. You must contact ODS and request academic adjustment letters at the beginning of each semester.
 
## Academic Integrity
All Penn State policies regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course (see links below for policy statements). Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. All University policies regarding academic integrity apply to this course. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students. For any material or ideas obtained from other sources, such as the text or things you see on the web, in the library, etc., a source reference must be given. Direct quotes from any source must be identified as such. All exam answers must be your own, and you must not provide any assistance to other students during exams. Any instances of academic dishonesty WILL be pursued under the University and Eberly College of Science regulations concerning academic integrity (http://science.psu.edu/current-students/Integrity/Policy.html). 

## Reporting Bias
Penn State is committed to creating an educational environment that is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others. As an educational institution, the University has a mandate to address problems of a society deeply ingrained with bias and prejudice. Students who experience a possible bias-motivated incident are urged to report it immediately by calling 911 if physical injury has occurred or is imminent and/or to file a report on the Report Bias website at http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias. 

## Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.
