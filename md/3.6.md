# Lecture 22: Digging deeper into protein-DNA interactions

In this lecture, we will cover several additional aspects of characterizing protein-DNA interactions from regulatory genomics assays. Topics in this lecture include:
- Pinpointing protein-DNA binding sites with EM.
- Finding differential protein-DNA interactions.
- Characterizing protein-DNA binding subtypes.
- Measuring chromatin interactions and the 3-D organization of the genome.
