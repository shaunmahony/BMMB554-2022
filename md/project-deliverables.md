# Project Deliverables

## Project Presentations

Project presentations will be on Apr. 26th and Apr. 28th. Your presentation should briefly summarize the motivation/question behind your project, what methods/approaches you used, and the main results. **Time is strictly limited to 5-6 minutes**, so I would recommend **no more than 4 slides**.

Due to the limited time between presentations, we will only be running the presentations from the lecturn computer. All slide decks should be in Powerpoint or PDF format. You are required to submit your presentations via Canvas by 6pm the day before your scheduled presentation. I will not accept late presentation submissions.
