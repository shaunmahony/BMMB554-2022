# Lectures 24-27: Reading list

In this section of the course, we will discuss several articles relating to current challenges in computational biology and genomics. The articles we will discuss in class are chosen to illustrate new types of genomic data or current challenges in the field. They will not necessarily provide introductory-level background to the topic. Because of this, I have also (where possible) included some relevant review articles on the reading list.

**Please come prepared to discuss these papers!**

## L24: Statial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq

**Discussion article:**
- Moncada, et al. "Integrating microarray-based spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq reveals tissue architecture in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas", **Nature Biotechnology** 38:p333–342 (2020) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0392-8

**Review articles:**
- Kiselev, et al. "Challenges in unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data", **Nature Reviews Genetics** 20:p273–282 (2019) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9
- Rao, et al. "Exploring tissue architecture using spatial transcriptomics", **Nature** 596:p211–220 (2021) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03634-9


## L25: CRISPR-based screening

**Discussion article:**
- Guo, et al. "Profiling the genetic determinants of chromatin accessibility with scalable single-cell CRISPR screens", **Nature Biotechnology** 39:p1270–1277 (2021) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00902-x

**Review articles:**
