# Lecture 17: RNA-seq I

In this section of the course, we turn our focus to functional genomics approaches that use sequencing technologies to tell us something about the biological activities occuring within a set of cells. We begin by focusing on RNA-seq, which aims to characterize transcriptional activities in a cell population by sequencing RNA populations.
