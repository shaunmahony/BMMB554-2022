# Lecture 7: Working with the shell

In this lecture, we will gain some familiarity with the Unix shell (i.e., the command line). Working with the shell is necessary to do many data analysis tasks. For example, many bioinformatics software tools are only available in command line form. Similarly, many high-performance computing resources will not have a GUI interface for you to interact with; you will instead have to log in via ssh into a command line interface. And most importantly, the shell will enable you to automate complex data analysis tasks and have them execute in a reproducible way.

Today, we are going to cover some elements in the [Software Carpentry Unix Shell workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). I recommend that you go through that entire tutorial at your own pace.

## Setting up the shell

First, let's get set up with a Unix-like shell on your own system.

**MacOS:**
If you have a Mac, you already have a built-in shell. Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight.

**Windows:**

*Windows version 10+*
You can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux which gives access to a Bash shell command-line tool in Windows 10. You should be able to do so by opening Powershell from an administrator account and typing the following:
```
wsl --install
```
[More detailed instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), but the above line should be all you need for now.

*Older Windows machines, or no admin access*
As an alternative to Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can install a Bash emulator via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).


## Getting started

We are going to follow some of the lessons in (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). First go to (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html), download the shell-lesson-data.zip file linked on that page, and move it to your Desktop. Once that's done, you can read some motivation for learning how to interact with the shell in [the introduction](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/index.html).

There are several reasons for learning how to run programs from a command-line interface. In bioinformatics (and data analysis more broadly), many software programs do not have a GUI, and must be run from the command line. And it is often most convenient to log in to high-performance computing environments via the shell. But more importantly, the shell can empower us to perform complex data processing and analysis steps in a small number of commands. It also allows us to automate analyses in a reproducible way. So learning to interact with the shell is a critical data analysis skill.

Like everything else in data analysis, there are many different commands and syntax rules that come along with the shell. But you can do a lot by just learning a few simple commands. We will focus on just introducing the shell today, but I encourage you to revisit the Software Carpentry tutorial to gain more familiarity with the topics and tools we will briefly cover today.

## Navigating files and directories

Let's learn how to move around the file system using the first lesson in the Software Carpentry tutorial: (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html)

**Key commands**

|Command | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
|`pwd` | Print working directory. Which directory are you "in" |
|`ls` | List the contents of a directory |
|`ls -la` | List all contents of a directory (incl. hidden files) in long format |
|`man <cmd>` | Manual (help) |
|`cd <dir>` | Change directory |
|`cd ~` | Change to home directory |
|`cd ../` | Change to directory one level up |
|`cd -` | Change to last directory |

## Working with files and directories

We're now going to learn how to copy, move, and edit files and directories using the second tutorial lesson: (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)

**Key commands**

|Command | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
|`mkdir <dir>` | Make a new directory |
|`mv <file> <newfile>` | Move a file or directory |
|`cp <file> <newfile>` | Copy a file |
|`cp -R <dir> <newdir>` | Copy a directory recursively |
|`rm <file>` | Remove a file |
|`rm -R <dir>` | Remove a directory recursively *be careful!!*|
|`nano <file>` | A simple text editor |
|`cat <file>` | Return the contents of a file to the terminal |
|`head <file>` | Return the top few lines in a file to the terminal |
|`tail <file>` | Return the last few lines in a file to the terminal |


## Combining commands with pipes and filters

The output of one command can be directly input into another command. This allows you to build up quite complex chains of commands to process or parse data. Let's see how in the third tutorial lesson: (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter/index.html)

**Key commands**

|Command | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
|`cmd1 > file` | Redirect output of cmd1 into file|
|`cmd1 >> file` | Append output of cmd1 to end of file|
|`cmd1 \| cmd2` | Send the output of cmd1 to the input of cmd2 |
|`wc <file>` | Word count |
|`sort <file>` | Sort contents of file/stream |
|`cut -f1 <file>` | Extract the first column of file (default: tab separated)|
|`grep <query> <file(s)>` | Finds lines that match query in files|


## Loops

The shell includes syntax for if statements and loops, allowing you to write shell "programs" to process files. Loops are particularly useful for repeating the same action/analysis over multiple files. Let's see how (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/index.html)

**Key syntax**

```
for thing in list_of_things
do
    operation_using $thing    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility
done
```

```
while read line
do
	operation_using $line
done < file
```

## Shell scripts

In the last SoftwareCarpentry tutorial, we will see how to write and use shell scripts (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script/index.html). Shell scripts consist of merely a set of shell commands that are stored in a file and that can be re-run by the bash shell. 

**Example execution:**

```
bash script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
```

You can pass arguments into the script as shown above. To reference those arguments, use ```$1``` for the first argument, etc.

## Python scripts from the command line
