# Numpy & Scipy Basics

There are several different data structures one can use to hold and manipulate data in Python. The most commonly used in data sciences are the native data structures (Lists), NumPy arrays, and Pandas DataFrames. Each of these different data structure types have their own advantages in different settings.

Lists are the most basic data container, which can hold sequences of different data types.

NumPy arrays can be N-dimensional and enable fast and memory-efficient scientific computing.

Pandas DataFrames provide a powerful way to represent and manipulate tabular data. However, Pandas data structures can be slower and less memory efficient than NumPy arrays.

Summary of properties (from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-list-numpy-and-pandas-3a32f1aee948))

| |Mutability | Homogeneity | Accessibility | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|list | mutable | heterogeneous | integer position | Python built-in data structure |
|numpy.ndarray | mutable | homogeneous | integer position | high-performance array calculations |
|pandas.DataFrame | mutable | heterogeneous | integer position or index | tabular data structure |

We can also transform between the 3 main data structures (image from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-list-numpy-and-pandas-3a32f1aee948))

You are likely to use all types of data structure in your research, each in different scenarios. We will introduce NumPy arrays today. We will also briefly introduce a powerful library of scientific computing functions, SciPy, which can be used to analyze data in NumPy arrays.

Let's use the following noteboooks:
