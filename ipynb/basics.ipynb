In many languages (e.g., C, C++), there is an intermediate step where we need to ''compile'' or translate the code into a form that the computer can execute. Python is an interpreted programming language; this means that there is no ''compile'' step, but rather the code is interpreted by the Python interpreter on the fly when we execute the program. This doesn't make much difference to us at this point, but just know that when we talk about a Python ''interpreter'' below, it is the program that is reading our code and translating it into machine instructions.
